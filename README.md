Abstract:
This project aims at exploring neural activity and neurons correlations with behaviour in Drosophila flies. Data collected in the UPRAMDYA laboratory at EPFL provided neural activity, joint angles and
joint 3D poses of the Drosophila fly for 12 trials. This data was analyzed to better understand how neural signals control limb movement. Groups of neurons with similar signals were found, suggesting
that the motor control in Drosophila uses multiple neurons in parallel possibly for better robustness. Correlations between neurons and joint angles were stronger than those with behavior, suggesting
that the neurons recorded are Descending Neurons. Behavior classification from neuronal activity was found to be possible. In particular, with the implementation of a more advanced neural network
classifier remarkably good performance metrics were achieved for the prediction of multiple behaviors. A logistic regression method may be enough, depending on the level of accuracy needed, for a
reasonable enough quality prediction in the case of a binary classification. These results constitute an important step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the function of different neurons.
