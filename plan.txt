Aim: predict behaviour
1. find correlation neural data vs behavioural probability
	neural correlating with each other W10.1.1 (to see which neuron to use): MATHIAS
	PCA+wavelet
	compare multivariate regression on the denoised data & on features extracted from dimensionality reduction
	
	
2. find a way to predict behaviour from joint-angles
	PCA: (ax.plot(pca.components_[0]) shows the features that impact the most -> compare these angles to what seems logical)
	Wavelet +PCA: HILA 
	regression: LORENZO
