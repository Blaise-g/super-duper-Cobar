Aim: predict behaviour. Can we better predict behaviour from neural data than from joint-angles?
For neuron: compare between classification done with features as:
	- neurons with best correlation to behaviour (multivariate regression)
	- neurons correlate with each other (MATHIAS) - choose them for classification
	- features extracted from PCA

For behaviour: compare between classification done with features as:
	- pick first 6 best manual features (e.g. tibia angle of 6 legs)
	- pick first 6 pca components
	+ do wavelet tranfrom

Compare between classification from neural data and from behavioural data



1. find correlation neural data vs behavioural probability
	neural correlating with each other W10.1.1 (to see which neuron to use): MATHIAS
	PCA+wavelet
	compare multivariate regression on the denoised data & on features extracted from dimensionality reduction

	regression: predict behaviour from single neurons (find out how neurons we need). Pick neurons from their correlation. Use them as features to predict behaviour.
	
	
	
2. find a way to predict behaviour from joint-angles
	PCA: (ax.plot(pca.components_[0]) shows the features that impact the most -> compare these angles to what seems logical)
	Wavelet + PCA: HILA 
	regression: LORENZO
