Aim: can we classify behaviour from neural data.

Intoduction:
c) open questions adresses: 
- are neurons activating together (do we have single neuron responsible for a specific behaviour/joint angle)?
- can we predict behaviour from neural activity?


method:
1 preprocessing
1.1 denoising LORENZO
1.2 deltaF/F	MATHIAS

results:
1. Investigate clustering of neurons activity: find neurons that correlate with each other (multiple neurons are responsible) (PCA+clustering+correlation) HILA
1.1 PCA
1.2 clustering
1.3 correlation evaluation (triangle figure)

2. correlation between neurons and ... (rectangle figures)
2.1 behaviour
2.2 joint angle
2.3 compare correlation of neurons clustered before

3. predict behaviour from neuron: multivariate regression
3.1 using whole data set
3.2 using specific sets of neurons (sorted neurons from correlation)
